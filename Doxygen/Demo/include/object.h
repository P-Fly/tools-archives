 * Objects are now grouped by functionality into separate

 * by link order.
 *
 * The 'id' arg to __define_object() is needed so that multiple objects
 * can point at the same handler without causing duplicate-symbol build errors.
 *
 * Objects are run by placing pointers in object sections that the
 * kernel iterates at runtime. The linker can do dead code / data elimination
 * and remove that completely, so the objects sections have to be marked
 * as 'used' in the linker attribute.
